# FAQ Toggler

There is a pre defined component <code>Faq</code>,which takes two props and shows them.
By default the <code>text</code> prop is not being displayed, this is because of the styles we have.

Upon clicking the button with class <code>faq-toggle</code>, it should add or remove class
<code>active</code> from the root <code>Faq</code> div.

By default it should be closes i.e not having <code>active</code> class.
